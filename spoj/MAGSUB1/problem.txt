Lucifer MorningStar is interested in deepest desires of Zing. Being a programmer Zing said he has a desire of knowing number of magical substrings in a string. A substring of string S is said to be magical if it contains atleast one magical character (A character is magical if its value is prime, and we assign values to characters as:  A is assigned 1 , B is assigned 2......Z is assigned 26). So you have to calculate total number of magical substrings for S in order to help Lucifer who is absolutely newbie in programming, so that he does not disappoint Zing.
